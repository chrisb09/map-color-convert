# PDN Plugin

Extract the .zip file and execute that .bat

## Description

This paint.net plugin is a tool designed to simplify the process of converting an image to one that uses only the colors usable by minecraft in-game maps, so you can see what it looks like before going through the hassle of loading the images in-game. Be advised that maps themselves have a resolution of 128x128 each, adressing this is not part of this plugin.

## Examples

Below are examples of how images are converted. Left side is the original, right side using the minecraft map color palette.

### Example 1: Great Wave
